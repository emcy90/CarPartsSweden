### This collection contains 3 parts that are seperated (not connected to each other).
  If you want to know a customers car, then you have to search on "_id" with "owner_id" from this customers collection.
  Same goes for other collections.

  If you for example want to know which customer the payment info belongs to, then you have to search with
  "customer_paid_bill_id" on "_id" ###
